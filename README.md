A collection of various side projects to practice several data structures
***
**Statistical Data Manipulator:** A simple tool that manipulates a biostatistical data file with multiple functionalities.

**Linked List Security Lines Manager**: A system that simulates a queue for multiple lines.  
The system itself is a linked list made of lines that are also linkedlists made of the "Person" class. This system provides an interactive UI that allows the user to add 'Persons' to the queue, retrieve 'Persons' from the queue, add more lines to the queue, and remove lines from the queue.  
Each Person has a seat number and the system itself manages each line to be in ascending order of each Person's seat number. It also manages itself to have approximately equal line sizes for all lines at all times.

**Library Stack Manager**: In progress......
